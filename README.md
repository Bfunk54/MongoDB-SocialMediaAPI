## Usage
#
To use it, run that 'npm run dev' command and then you can use your favorite API Editor such as Postman or Insomnia to access it at 'localhost:3001'. Now go to the routes folder to see what routes to run. All routes will have /api first and everything should work well. You can use the seeds in the seed folder to get you started.
